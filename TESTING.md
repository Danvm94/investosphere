### **Javascript Testing**

#### **allowOnlyLetters**

The registration form includes a username field that employs
the `allowOnlyLetters` function for input validation. The purpose of this
validation is to ensure that only letters (alphabetic characters) are allowed
in the username field, disallowing any non-text characters.

Manual testing has been conducted, and it has been verified that
the `allowOnlyLetters` function functions correctly, preventing the entry of
non-text characters in the username field as intended.

This validation enhances the security and user experience of the registration
process by ensuring that usernames consist only of alphabetic characters.

#### **fadeOutAndHideElementsAutomatically**

users have the ability to input a specific cryptocurrency amount, and the
calculator instantly computes the equivalent value in USD. This provides users
with a valuable tool for evaluating their cryptocurrency holdings in terms of
USD currency.

## **Validators**

### **CI Python Linter**

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was employed to validate
the Python code throughout this project. Necessary adjustments have been
implemented to ensure compliance with PEP8 formatting and validations. You can
refer to the following git commit to review the files where these fixes were
applied.

[Commit 5ccee3e](https://github.com/Danvm94/investosphere/commit/5ccee3e25a82cee5313c8b58d6581d0a67a99502?diff=split)

### **W3C CSS Validator**

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate
the site's CSS code.

### **W3C Markup Validator**

All pages were run through
the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). Initially, there were
some errors due to missing closing tags, image height values, and Richtextfield
inputs. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation.

Due to the Django templating language code used in the HTML files, these could
not be copied and pasted into the validator and due to the secured views, pages
with login required or a secured view cannot be validated by direct URI. To
test the validation on the files, open the page to validate, right click and
view page source. Paste the raw HTML code into the validator as this will be
only the HTML-rendered code.

### **JSHint**

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the Javascript code used in
the project.

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the
python code used throughout the project. The results are outlined in below:

#### **scripts.js**
