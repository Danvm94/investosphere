## **Project Goals**

This is my fourth  portfolio project, showcasing my proficiency in web development frameworks like Bootstrap and Django. My objective with this project is to demonstrate how I can leverage these skills effectively. I have chosen to create a cryptocurrency-focused website that integrates with real-time market data using external APIs.

The website will serve as a platform for users to explore, simulate, and plan cryptocurrency investments without using real money. It aims to provide a safe and educational environment for users to develop and refine their investment strategies. This project reflects my commitment to combining technical expertise with real-world applications, offering users a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investment planning and education.

## **Agile Planning**

This project was developed using agile methodologies, focusing on delivering small features across the project's duration. User Stories were prioritized under the labels "Must Have," "Should Have," and "Could Have."

This approach ensured that all essential requirements were addressed initially, providing a comprehensive foundation for the project. In certain cases, some "Could Have" features were implemented ahead of schedule, particularly if they were straightforward, such as Trending/Top Rated Movies. Other features were integrated based on available capacity and timing.

The project utilized a Kanban board created on Github projects, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/Danvm94/projects/4). This board provided detailed information about project cards. All User Stories included a set of acceptance criteria to define the functionality required for story completion.

## **The Skeleton Plane**
#### **Wireframes**
For this project, wireframes were created using Balsamiq. While wireframes were developed primarily for the home page, the design for other pages naturally evolved from the base.html template and certain elements of the home webpage.

The wireframes served as a visual guide to outline the layout and structure of the home page, providing a clear representation of the overall design and user interface. This approach allowed for flexibility in designing additional pages, ensuring consistency in the user experience throughout the project.

#### **Database Schema**

The database schema for this project includes the following models:

- The **Crypto** model stores information about cryptocurrencies.
  - Fields:
    - `name`: CharField for storing the name of the cryptocurrency (unique).
- The **Wallet** model represents user wallets, linked to the built-in User model. Each wallet contains information about the user's available dollars, and a timestamp of creation.
  - Fields:
    - `user`: One-to-One relationship with the User model.
    - `dollars`: Decimal field for storing dollar amounts.
    - `created_at`: Timestamp for creation.

- The **Cryptos** model represents cryptocurrency holdings of users, linked to the User model and the Crypto model. It stores information about the user's cryptocurrency holdings and the specific cryptocurrency's symbol.
  - Fields:
    - `user`: ForeignKey relationship with the User model.
    - `crypto`: ForeignKey relationship with the Crypto model.
    - `amount`: Decimal field for storing the cryptocurrency amount.
  - Additional Methods:
    - `formatted_amount`: Formats the cryptocurrency amount for display.
    - `symbol`: Property for retrieving the cryptocurrency's name.

- The **Transactions** model tracks user transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. It contains information about the user, transaction type, symbol, amount, and creation timestamp.
  - Fields:
    - `user`: ForeignKey relationship with the User model.
    - `type`: CharField for the transaction type.
    - `symbol`: CharField for the symbol (e.g., 'dollar').
    - `amount`: Decimal field for storing the transaction amount.
    - `created_at`: Timestamp for creation.
  - Additional Methods:
    - `formatted_amount`: Formats the transaction amount for display.

This schema defines the structure of your project's database, facilitating the management of user wallets, cryptocurrency holdings, and transaction records.

#### **Security Measures**

Security is a top priority in the development of this project. Several security measures have been implemented to protect user data and sensitive information.

- **User Authentication**

To ensure that only authorized users access certain views and functionalities, the Django `@login_required` decorator has been applied. This means that specific views can only be accessed by registered and authenticated users. If an unauthenticated user attempts to access such views, they will be automatically redirected to the login page.

- **Protection of Sensitive Data**

To safeguard secret keys, API keys, and other sensitive information, environment variables have been utilized. During local development, these variables are stored in an `env.py` file, ensuring that no confidential data is exposed in the project repository. In the production environment (e.g., on Heroku), these variables are securely managed through Heroku's config vars.

These security measures are in place to provide a safe and reliable user experience while protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
