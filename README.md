## **Project Goals**

This is my fourth  portfolio project, showcasing my proficiency in web development frameworks like Bootstrap and Django. My objective with this project is to demonstrate how I can leverage these skills effectively. I have chosen to create a cryptocurrency-focused website that integrates with real-time market data using external APIs.

The website will serve as a platform for users to explore, simulate, and plan cryptocurrency investments without using real money. It aims to provide a safe and educational environment for users to develop and refine their investment strategies. This project reflects my commitment to combining technical expertise with real-world applications, offering users a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investment planning and education.
